## Overview

- Users are directed to a site where they will put in a city name and a picture of that city, as well as weather and movie information will populate the page after they hit the explore button.

## Getting Started

- Build a front-end and a back-end that will communicate with 3rd party API's

## Architecture

- There will be a simple search box witha title directing the user to type in that box. The background will have a travel related background. The map image will have rounded corners and the lat a lon will be displayed in a bootstrap component. The weather will be displayed below that in boxes and the movie information will be in a carousel.
